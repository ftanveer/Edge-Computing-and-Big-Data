# Edge-Computing-and-Big-Data
Edge Computing in the Metaverse Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality infrastructure. 

#Objective
The objective of this project is to research and report on Edge Computing as applied primarily to
the upcoming Metaverse Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality infrastructure. The Metaverse will
combine both big data and a virtual reality/augmented reality world representation. For example,
users go shopping in a digital store for digital goods using a VR headset. We discuss the
scalability, reliability, speed, efficiency, and privacy/Security concerns in each section below.

#Conclusion
The vast amounts of data collected and stored as part of the Metaverse necessitates the use of
Edge Computing. The Metaverse will require constant processing and updating of data and
need a quick, reliable, and efficient means of dealing with this data. In the Metaverse, privacy
concerns in the “2D” world are exacerbated and its reach widened. The two most obvious
concerns are user safety and information privacy. The Metaverse is still in its infancy and its
needs will likely evolve as it is implemented, and this poses an opportunity for the expansion of
our capacity in data processing, potentially even beyond the current limits of Edge Computing.
